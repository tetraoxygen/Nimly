Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent. Generate a random integer between 10 and 100 to denote the initial size of the pile. Generate a second random integer between 0 and 1 to decide whether the computer or the human takes the first turn. Implement a stupid vs. smart mode for the computer. In stupid mode, the computer simply takes a random legal value (between 1 and n/2) from the pile whenever it has a turn. In smart mode, the computer takes off enough marbles to make the size of the pile a power of 2 minus 1 - that is 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63. That is always a legal move, except when the size of the pile is currently one less than a power of two. In that case, the computer makes a random legal move.
